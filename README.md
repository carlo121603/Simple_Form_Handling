Simple Form with PHP Processing
This project contains a basic HTML form that collects user input, including first name, second name, and age. The form submits data to a PHP script (submit.php) that processes the input, displays the submitted values, and performs basic validation. If any field is left empty, the user is redirected back to the form after 2 seconds with a message prompting them to fill in all fields.

Features:
User input collection via an HTML form
PHP-based form handling and validation
Input sanitization to prevent security risks
Auto redirection if fields are left empty

How to Use:
Open index.html in a web browser.
Enter your details and click Submit.
View the submitted data or get prompted to fill in missing fields.

Requirements:
PHP server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP)
Web browser
